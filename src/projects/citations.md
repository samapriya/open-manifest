#### **Citing Open Manifest**
Open manifest is a community effort that I hope to grow and convert into an online submission tool, as Earth Engine evolves over a period of time, methods to ingest and look at data sets and collections might change. But we hope this acts as a community library for manifest submission and allowing for data harmonization for field, remote datasets (both commercial and public datasets)
